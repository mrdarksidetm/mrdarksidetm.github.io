### [2026-09-20 11:05:00 IST] - Master Hub Overhaul to Vector Drawable Design Language & Live Auto-Sync
- **Author**: mrdarksidetm
- **Status**: Completed complete redesign and deployment of the master portfolio hub.
- **Architectural & Design Enhancements**:
  - Transitioned the entire master GitHub Pages site (`mrdarksidetm.github.io`) to the **Vector Drawable** dark Material 3 Expressive design language.
  - Implemented standard color tokens: `--vd-color-bg: #121212`, `--vd-color-surface: #1e1e1e`, `--vd-color-primary: #269bff`, `--vd-color-stroke: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)`.
  - Implemented dual-font typography with Google Fonts `DM Sans` for headlines/body and `JetBrains Mono` for tags, badges, and terminal snippets.
  - Built comprehensive featured showcase cards for all flagship products:
    - **VectorDrawable to SVG** (Next.js web utility)
    - **Wallet (Native Jetpack Compose)** (Android, Room SQLite, 8 Financial Hubs, Canvas Hero)
    - **Wallet-Flutter** (Flutter, Isar DB, Riverpod)
    - **Wasm** (WhatsApp & Instagram chat archive manager, in-app audio player)
    - **Battery Mode Checker (ABUC)** (Doze auditor, Shizuku rootless privilege bridge)
    - **WinForge** (Windows 11 Recall purge & gaming optimization toolkit)
  - Built real-time **Dynamic Live GitHub Ecosystem** section:
    - Automatically fetches all public repositories via GitHub REST API (`https://api.github.com/users/mrdarksidetm/repos`).
    - Dynamically renders any newly created or updated repositories with star counts, language tags, and direct links without requiring manual site re-deployments.
    - Added LocalStorage caching with background re-fetch to protect against GitHub API rate limits.
  - Added interactive segmented category filter buttons (`All Products`, `Native Android`, `Flutter`, `Web & Converters`, `System Toolkits`) and real-time search input.
  - Added 1-tap clipboard copy terminal snippet for `npx vector-drawable-svg` with animated checkmark feedback.
  - Redesigned `about.html` with matching Vector Drawable aesthetic and developer specs.
